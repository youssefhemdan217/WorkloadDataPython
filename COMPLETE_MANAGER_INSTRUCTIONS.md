- **Subsequent startups** are faster

- **Restart weekly** for best performance

### Troubleshooting
- **If apps won't start**: Run .bat files as administrator
- **If no data appears**: Wait 2-3 minutes for loading
- **If errors occur**: Close all applications and restart
- **For detailed help**: See `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` in the package

- **Click "More info" ‚Üí "Run anyway"**
- This happens because applications aren't digitally signed
