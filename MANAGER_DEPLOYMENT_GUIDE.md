## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Receive and Extract
1. **Download/Copy** the FABSI_Deployment package
2. **Extract** (if zipped) to a local folder on your computer
   - Recommended location: `C:\FABSI_Apps\` or `Desktop\FABSI_Apps\`
3. **Verify** all files are present (see package structure above)

### Step 2: Security Considerations
1. **Antivirus**: Your antivirus may flag the .exe files as suspicious
   - This is normal for new applications
   - **Add the FABSI_Deployment folder to your antivirus whitelist**
2. **Windows Security**: Windows may show "Windows protected your PC" warning
   - Click "More info" → "Run anyway"
   - This happens because the applications are not digitally signed

### Step 3: First Run Test
1. **Run as Administrator** (right-click → "Run as administrator"):
   - `FABSI_List_of_Services.exe`
   - Wait for it to load completely (1-2 minutes)
   - Close the application
2. **Repeat for** `FABSI_Project_Booking.exe`
3. **Success indicators**:
   - Applications start without errors
   - Data loads and displays
   - No error messages appear

## 💼 Manager Setup Recommendations

### For Your Organization
1. **Create Standard Installation**:
   - Set up on one computer first
   - Test all functionality
   - Create step-by-step instructions for your team

2. **Network Deployment** (if needed):
   - Copy the entire FABSI_Deployment folder to each user's computer
   - **Do NOT run from network drives** - copy locally for best performance
   - Each user will have their own database copy

3. **User Training**:
   - Provide users with the QUICK_START.md guide
   - Schedule 30-minute training sessions
   - Designate a local expert for support

### Data Management Strategy
1. **Backup Policy**:
   - The `Database/workload.db` file contains ALL data
   - Implement daily backups of this file
   - Store backups in secure location (OneDrive, SharePoint, etc.)

2. **Data Sharing** (if needed):
   - Each installation has its own database
   - For shared data, consider scheduled database synchronization
   - Or designate one "master" installation for data entry

## 🔒 Security and Compliance

### Data Security
- All data is stored locally in SQLite database
- No internet connection required for operation
- No data transmitted to external servers
- Complies with local data protection policies

### User Access
- Applications run with standard user permissions
- Database access is file-based (no server required)
- Can be restricted using Windows file permissions
