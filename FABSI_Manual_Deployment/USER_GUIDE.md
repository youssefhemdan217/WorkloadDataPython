## üîÑ Data Management

### Database Location
- The main database file is located at: `Database/workload.db`
- **IMPORTANT**: Do not delete or move this file - it contains all your data

### Backup Recommendations
1. **Regular backups**: Copy the entire `FABSI_Deployment` folder to a backup location weekly
2. **Database backup**: Specifically backup the `Database/workload.db` file daily
3. **Cloud storage**: Consider storing backups on cloud storage (OneDrive, Google Drive, etc.)

### Data Sharing Between Applications
- Both applications use the same database (`workload.db`)
- Changes made in one application are immediately available in the other
- You can run both applications simultaneously if needed
