   - Right-click on the .exe file
   - Select "Run as administrator"
   - Click "Yes" if prompted by Windows

2. **Check Antivirus**:
   - Your antivirus might be blocking the application
   - Add the FABSI_Deployment folder to your antivirus whitelist
   - Temporarily disable real-time protection and try again

3. **Check File Permissions**:
   - Ensure you have read/write access to the folder
   - Try moving the folder to a different location (e.g., Desktop)

#### Problem: "Application starts but crashes immediately"
**Solutions**:
1. **Check Database File**:
   - Ensure `Database/workload.db` exists
   - File should be around 1-50MB in size
   - If missing, restore from backup

2. **Check Dependencies**:
   - Make sure all folders (Database, Photos) are present
   - Don't separate the .exe files from supporting folders

### Data Loading Issues

#### Problem: "No data appears in the application"
**Solutions**:

2. **Data Dependency**:
   - Some dropdowns depend on others
   - Try selecting items in order: Project ‚Üí Technical Unit ‚Üí Employee
