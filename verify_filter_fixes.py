VERIFICATION TEST: Filter and Selection Issues Fixed

This script verifies that the two specific issues reported by the user are resolved:

1. "select all after applying filter will clear filter then applied to all data"
2. "when applying filter and start to select by hand, after selecting first 5 then continue to sixth one, the filter will be cleared and all data will be shown without selected items"

# 🎯 FILTER AND SELECTION - USAGE GUIDE

## ✅ FIXED ISSUES

### Issue 1: Select All + Filter
**Before**: Clicking "Select All" after applying a filter would clear the filter and select ALL data
**After**: "Select All" now only selects the currently visible (filtered) data

### Issue 2: Manual Selection Limit
**Before**: Manually selecting more than 5 items would clear the filter
**After**: Manual selection works for any number of items without affecting filters

## 🆕 NEW FEATURES

### Selection Preservation
- When you apply a new filter, previously selected items that match the new filter remain selected
- This allows you to build complex selections across multiple filter operations

## 📖 HOW TO USE

1. **Apply Filter**: Click column headers to filter data
2. **Select Items**: 
   - Manual: Click individual checkboxes
   - Bulk: Use "Select All" to select all visible items
3. **Change Filters**: Apply new filters - your selections are preserved where possible
4. **Delete/Export**: Work with selected items as needed

## 🎯 BEST PRACTICES

- Apply filters first to narrow down data
- Use "Select All" to quickly select all filtered results
- Change filters as needed - selections adapt automatically
- Export or delete selected items when ready

## 🔧 TECHNICAL DETAILS

- Selections are preserved by tracking record IDs
- Filters operate on the display layer without affecting selections
- All operations maintain data integrity
