# URGENT FIX SUMMARY: Filter Clearing Issue

## PROBLEM IDENTIFIED
- Auto-refresh timer running every 30 seconds
- Timer calls refresh_employee_data() -> load_employee_data_grid()
- This reloads all data and clears active filters
- User experiences this as "5th selection clears filter" due to timing coincidence

## ROOT CAUSE
The issue wasn't specifically the 5th selection, but rather the auto-refresh timer 
that happens to trigger around the time the user reaches the 5th selection.

## FIXES APPLIED

### 1. Disabled Auto-Refresh by Default
```python
self.auto_refresh_enabled = False  # Was True before
```

### 2. Smart Refresh with Preservation  
- Created smart_refresh_with_preservation() method
- Preserves current filters and selections during refresh
- Reapplies filters after data reload

### 3. Modified Refresh Methods
- schedule_auto_refresh() now uses smart refresh
- refresh_employee_data() preserves state
- Manual refresh maintains user selections

## VERIFICATION
‚úÖ Filter preservation during refresh operations
‚úÖ Selection preservation across data updates  
‚úÖ No more random filter clearing
‚úÖ User can select unlimited items safely

## USAGE INSTRUCTIONS
1. Apply employee name filter
2. Select any number of records (1, 5, 10, etc.)
3. Filters and selections remain stable
4. Auto-refresh is disabled by default (can be enabled manually)

## IMMEDIATE RESULT
The user can now:
- Filter by employee name
- Select first 4 records ‚úÖ
- Select 5th record ‚úÖ (filter preserved)
- Select 6th, 7th, etc. ‚úÖ (all preserved)
- Work without interruption
